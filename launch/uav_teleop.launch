		<!--
		Instructions: call the teleoperator on its own terminal, with "roslaunch aerial_manipulation uav_teleop.launch"
					- Keyboard use:
						Right-Left keys:  Yaw Orientation
						Up-Down keys   :  Vehicle Altitude
						w - s   keys   :  World-Frame X Position
						a - d   keys   :  World-Frame Y Position
		IMPORTANT:
				To close the teleoperator, press the 'q' key. This way you can close the teleoperator and keep keyboard access to that terminal window.
				Simply pressing Ctrl+C will either not work, or you will have to also close the window, as keyboard access is lost with the teleoperator
